        <h2>Policy</h2>
       <i>
        We take security seriously at Anonymous blog, and we’re committed to protecting our community. If you are a security
        researcher or expert and believe you’ve identified security-related issues with anonymous’s blog, we would
        appreciate you disclosing it to us responsibly.
        We are committed to addressing all security issues in a responsible and timely manner, and we ask the security community
        to give us the opportunity to do so before disclosing them publicly. Please submit a detailed description of the issue
        to us, along with the steps to reproduce it.

        <h4>When testing</h4>
        <i>
        Please include a header Test-anonymous: <b>"anon_(your username)"</b> when you test so we can identify your requests easily.
        </i>
        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <i>
        The scope of issues is limited to technical vulnerabilities on the Anonymous blog website. Please do not attempt to
        compromise the safety or privacy of our users.
        </i>
        <h4>Rewards</h4>
        <i>
        We will reward reports according to the severity of their impact on a case-by-case basis as determined by our security
        team. We may pay more for unique, hard-to-find bugs and less for bugs with complex prerequisites that lower the risk of
        exploitation.
        Below, you can find examples of vulnerabilities and their impacts grouped by our severity ranking. This is not an
        exhaustive list and it is designed to give you insight on how we rate vulnerabilities.
